The following CSS rule has a potential issue:

```css
div {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
  border: 10px solid red;
}
```

The `calc()` function calculates the width of the div, subtracting 20px from 100%.  However, the border adds 20px (10px on each side) to the div's total width.  This means the div's rendered width will actually be 100%, not the intended 100% - 20px.
